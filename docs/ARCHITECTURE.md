# Architecture Deep Dive

## Trading Speed & Latency Analysis

### Is 1-5 seconds too slow?

**It depends on your trading style:**

#### High-Frequency Trading (HFT) - Microseconds to Seconds
- **Too slow for**: Arbitrage, market making, front-running
- **Why**: Opportunities exist for milliseconds, profits are tiny (0.1-0.5%), need high volume
- **Competition**: You're competing with bots in datacenters next to exchanges
- **Verdict**: 1-5 seconds is way too slow ❌

#### Scalping/Day Trading - Seconds to Minutes
- **Maybe too slow for**: Quick momentum plays, breakout trading
- **Why**: In 5 seconds, price can move 1-5% in volatile tokens
- **Example**: See spike on Twitter → LLM analyzes (5 sec) → price already up 10%
- **Verdict**: Risky, might miss entry/exit points ⚠️

#### Swing Trading - Minutes to Hours
- **Probably fine for**: Trend following, momentum strategies
- **Why**: Holding positions for hours/days, 5 seconds doesn't matter much
- **Example**: LLM identifies bullish trend → buy → hold for 6 hours → sell
- **Verdict**: 5 seconds is acceptable ✅

#### Position Trading - Days to Weeks
- **Definitely fine for**: Long-term trend analysis, portfolio rebalancing
- **Why**: Making decisions over days/weeks, 5 seconds is irrelevant
- **Example**: LLM weekly analysis → adjust portfolio → hold for weeks
- **Verdict**: 5 seconds is completely fine ✅

### The Real Problem with LLM-Only Trading

The issue isn't just latency - it's **decision granularity**:

```
Scenario: Token pumps 20% in 2 minutes then dumps

LLM Approach (slow):
- Minute 0: Price $1.00
- Minute 1: Price $1.15 (LLM hasn't run yet, scheduled for every 5 min)
- Minute 2: Price $1.20 (LLM starts analyzing)
- Minute 2.5: LLM says "BUY!" (but price already peaked)
- Minute 3: Price $0.95 (pump over, you bought at $1.18)
- Result: -19% loss 📉

Fast Algorithm Approach:
- Minute 0: Price $1.00
- Minute 0.1: Detect volume spike + 5% price increase
- Minute 0.2: Buy at $1.05
- Minute 1.5: Detect momentum reversal (RSI, volume drop)
- Minute 1.6: Sell at $1.18
- Result: +12% gain 📈
```

## Hybrid Architecture: LLM + Fast Algorithms

### Division of Labor

#### LLM Responsibilities (Strategic Layer)
**Frequency**: Every 5-30 minutes, or on-demand for events

**Tasks**:
1. **Market Context Analysis**
   - "Is the broader Solana market bullish or bearish?"
   - "What's the overall market sentiment today?"
   - Analyze news, major events, market structure

2. **Token Selection & Watchlist Curation**
   - "Which tokens show promising fundamentals?"
   - "Are there any red flags for token X?" (audit issues, team concerns)
   - "What's the community saying about this new project?"

3. **Sentiment Interpretation**
   - Aggregate social data and interpret meaning
   - "Is this Twitter buzz organic or coordinated shilling?"
   - "What's the quality of discussion around this token?"

4. **Risk Assessment**
   - "Does this token show pump-and-dump characteristics?"
   - "Is the liquidity sufficient for our position size?"
   - "What are the key risks for this trade?"

5. **Strategy Adjustment**
   - "Should we be more aggressive or defensive based on market conditions?"
   - "Are our current parameters aligned with market volatility?"

**Output**: Strategic directives, watchlist updates, risk parameters

#### Fast Algorithms (Tactical Layer)
**Frequency**: Real-time (milliseconds to seconds)

**Tasks**:
1. **Signal Generation**
   ```rust
   // Example: Moving average crossover
   if short_ma > long_ma && prev_short_ma <= prev_long_ma {
       signal = Signal::Buy;
   }

   // RSI oversold
   if rsi < 30 && price_change_1h > -5% {
       signal = Signal::Buy;
   }

   // Volume spike detection
   if current_volume > avg_volume * 3 && price_up > 2% {
       signal = Signal::Buy;
   }
   ```

2. **Entry Timing**
   - Wait for optimal entry (support levels, limit orders)
   - Execute immediately when conditions met
   - Handle slippage and failed transactions

3. **Exit Timing**
   - Stop losses (hard exits at X% loss)
   - Take profit targets (sell at X% gain)
   - Trailing stops (follow price up, exit on reversal)
   - Momentum reversal detection

4. **Risk Management**
   - Position sizing based on volatility
   - Portfolio balance enforcement
   - Max position limits per token
   - Correlation checks (don't over-expose to correlated tokens)

5. **Order Execution**
   - Route through Jupiter for best price
   - Handle transaction failures
   - Retry logic with backoff
   - Slippage protection

**Output**: Buy/sell orders, position adjustments

## Fast Algorithm Strategies

### 1. Momentum Trading
```rust
struct MomentumStrategy {
    short_period: u32,  // e.g., 5 minutes
    long_period: u32,   // e.g., 20 minutes
    volume_threshold: f64,  // e.g., 2x average
}

impl MomentumStrategy {
    fn should_buy(&self, data: &MarketData) -> bool {
        let price_momentum = (data.price - data.price_20m_ago) / data.price_20m_ago;
        let volume_spike = data.volume_5m / data.avg_volume > self.volume_threshold;
        let rsi = data.rsi;

        // Buy if: strong upward momentum + volume spike + not overbought
        price_momentum > 0.03 && volume_spike && rsi < 70
    }

    fn should_sell(&self, data: &MarketData, entry_price: f64) -> bool {
        let profit_pct = (data.price - entry_price) / entry_price;
        let momentum_reversing = data.short_ma < data.long_ma;

        // Sell if: momentum reversing OR hit target OR stop loss
        momentum_reversing || profit_pct > 0.15 || profit_pct < -0.08
    }
}
```

### 2. Mean Reversion
```rust
struct MeanReversionStrategy {
    lookback_period: u32,  // e.g., 1 hour
    std_dev_threshold: f64,  // e.g., 2.0
}

impl MeanReversionStrategy {
    fn should_buy(&self, data: &MarketData) -> bool {
        // Buy when price drops significantly below mean
        let z_score = (data.price - data.mean_price) / data.std_dev;
        z_score < -self.std_dev_threshold && data.rsi < 35
    }

    fn should_sell(&self, data: &MarketData, entry_price: f64) -> bool {
        // Sell when price returns to mean
        let z_score = (data.price - data.mean_price) / data.std_dev;
        z_score > -0.5 || (data.price - entry_price) / entry_price > 0.10
    }
}
```

### 3. Breakout Detection
```rust
struct BreakoutStrategy {
    consolidation_period: u32,  // e.g., 30 minutes
    breakout_threshold: f64,  // e.g., 0.03 (3%)
}

impl BreakoutStrategy {
    fn should_buy(&self, data: &MarketData) -> bool {
        // Buy when price breaks above consolidation range with volume
        let range_high = data.range_high_30m;
        let breakout = data.price > range_high * (1.0 + self.breakout_threshold);
        let volume_confirmation = data.volume_5m > data.avg_volume * 1.5;

        breakout && volume_confirmation
    }
}
```

### Fast Algorithm Input Processing
```rust
struct TradingEngine {
    llm_directives: LLMDirectives,
    strategies: Vec<Box<dyn Strategy>>,
}

impl TradingEngine {
    async fn process_market_data(&self, data: MarketData) -> Option<Order> {
        // 1. Check if token is approved by LLM
        let token_directive = self.llm_directives.get_token_directive(&data.token);
        if token_directive.action == Action::Avoid {
            return None;
        }

        // 2. Run fast strategies

            .iter()
            .map(|s| s.generate_signal(&data))
            .collect();

        // 3. Aggregate signals
        let final_signal = self.aggregate_signals(signals);

        // 4. Apply LLM risk parameters
        if let Some(order) = self.create_order(final_signal, &data) {
            let order = self.apply_llm_constraints(order, &token_directive);
            return Some(order);
        }

        None
    }

    fn apply_llm_constraints(&self, mut order: Order, directive: &TokenDirective) -> Order {
        // Cap position size based on LLM recommendation
        order.size = order.size.min(directive.max_position_pct);

        // Set stop loss from LLM
        order.stop_loss = Some(directive.stop_loss_pct);

        // Adjust for market conditions
        order.size *= self.llm_directives.risk_parameters.volatility_adjustment;

        order
    }
}
```

## Timing Strategy

### Optimal Update Frequencies

| Component | Frequency | Reasoning |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Price data | 100ms - 1s | Real-time for entry/exit |
| Technical indicators | 1-5s | Smooth out noise |
| Volume analysis | 5-30s | Detect meaningful changes |
| Order execution | Immediate | Don't miss price |
| LLM strategic analysis | 5-30 min | Markets don't change that fast |
| LLM sentiment analysis | 15-60 min | Social trends are slower |
| LLM risk review | 1-6 hours | Daily/semi-daily adjustments |

### When to Trigger LLM Analysis

**Scheduled**:
- Every 30 minutes during active trading
- Once per hour during monitoring mode
- Daily market overview

**Event-Driven**:
- Major price movement (>10% in 5 min)
- Volume spike (>5x average)
- Social mention surge (>10x baseline)
- Portfolio loss exceeds threshold (e.g., -5%)
- New token enters top 100 by volume
- Manual trigger via API

## Recommended Approach

**For your use case** (Solana tokens, momentum + sentiment):

1. **Fast algorithms handle**:
   - Entry/exit timing (seconds)
   - Stop losses and take profits
   - Risk management enforcement

2. **LLM handles**:
   - Which tokens to trade (updated every 30-60 min)
   - Market sentiment interpretation
   - Risk parameter adjustment
   - Post-trade pattern learning

3. **Hybrid decision**:
   - LLM curates watchlist + sets risk params
   - Fast algo waits for technical entry signal
   - Fast algo executes trade
   - Fast algo manages exit
   - LLM reviews and learns

**This gives you**:
- Speed when it matters (execution)
- Intelligence when it matters (strategy)
- Lower API costs (LLM runs infrequently)
- Better performance (don't miss opportunities)

## Next Question

**What's your target holding period?**
- Minutes to hours (day trading) → Need more speed, LLM is advisory only
- Hours to days (swing trading) → Hybrid approach works great
- Days to weeks (position trading) → LLM can be more involved in decisions

This will help finalize the architecture.
